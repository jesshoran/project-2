# project-2

# Explanations of technologies used:

Made a CRUD app using: MVC model, JSX, Mongoose, Express, Node JS, HTML, CSS and Boostrap.

# Approach:

I started out using by just creating my basic MVP, which was just a basic workout app using the 7 Restful Routes. From there, I added in separate routes for the music and pages for those. After that, I added in the member componenet.

# Unsolved Problems:

I wouldn't say unsolved, but some things I'd like to change in the future:
-   Authentication for the users
-   When users comment, add a picture
-   Allow users to actually sign up for the classes they want to take


# User Stories:

Users can add themselves to the database, search workouts by music genre as well as view, edit, delete, comment on individual workouts.

# Notes:
-   Add members as carousel across the homepage- check out our community type thing
-   Add calendar or ability to search  by day
-   Filter system
-   Search Bar
